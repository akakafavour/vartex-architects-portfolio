const FAQS = [
    { q: "What services does Vartex Architects provide?", a: "We offer comprehensive architectural design, interior design, and project management services for residential and commercial builds. Our work ranges from essential 2D technical drafting to immersive 3D visualizations, custom joinery design, and construction supervision." },
    { q: "How much does it cost to design a house?", a: "Costs depend on your site and the scope of your project, since every design is different. We offer Basic, Standard, and Premium packages, each with a starting price. The Standard Architecture package is intended for typical residential designs up to roughly 350 sqm; larger or more complex plots get a custom quote." },
    { q: "How are payments structured?", a: "We use a transparent, phased billing structure. Projects are divided into milestones such as Concept, Design Development, and Construction Drawings. You approve and pay for each phase before we move to the next." },
    { q: "Do you handle the actual construction of the building?", a: "We are primarily a design and consulting studio, but we offer Project Management and Construction Administration services. As Lead Consultant, we support contractor tendering, cost evaluation, and regular site inspections to help ensure the building matches the approved architectural design." },
    { q: "Can I customize the design packages?", a: "Yes. Packages contain core and optional deliverables, including structural engineering coordination, mechanical and electrical layouts, and premium physical printing. Optional deliverables can be adjusted during the proposal stage to suit your project." },
    { q: "Do you help with government building approvals?", a: "Yes. Clients who select Standard or Premium architectural packages receive drawing sets prepared, formatted, and collated for submission to your local planning authority." },
    { q: "Do you only take projects in Lagos?", a: "We are based in Lagos and handle many site-specific projects here, but we can provide architectural blueprints, 3D visualizations, and interior design consultation for projects elsewhere as long as you can provide an accurate site survey and measurements." },
    { q: "How do we get started?", a: "Send an email to Info@vartexarchitects.com, message us on WhatsApp at +234 704 900 1510, or call +234 703 269 7179 to schedule your initial consultation. We will discuss your project goals and recommend the most suitable design package." },
